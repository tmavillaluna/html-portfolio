<h1>Trisha's Favorite KDramas</h1>
<h2>My Top 5 KDrama Recommendation</h2>
<hr />

<h3>1. Goblin</h3>
<p>It is a good cry KDrama. And after watching it multiple times, it still gets me and make me feel all the feels after watching it for the first time.</p>
<h3>2. Reply 1988</h3>
<p>Nostalgia. One word to describe it. Brings back all the memories and feelings from the past. Care free teenagers, worry and problem free life.</p>
<h3>3. Start Up</h3>
<p>Nam Joo Hyuk always depicts what I is actually happening in the season of my life. When I watched it, I'm in the season of my life when I feel dumb after being the achiever kid on my "glory days".</p>
<h3>4. 2521</h3>
<p>Nam Joo Hyuk did it again, this time I can relate as a working adult. Not sure of career and life would offer me.</p>
<h3>5. Hospital Playlist</h3>
<p>I love a slice of life drama and this is what Hospital Playlist is all about. It comforts me during my review days and gives me excitement every week for new episodes. One of my stress reliever during review days.</p>
<h3>Bonus Kdrama Favorite: Moving (Ongoing Kdrama)</h3>
