<h1>Abou Me</h1>
<p>
  I am a Registered Electrical Engineer who specializes in electrical and electronics design and AutoCAD. 
  I am equipped with certification and experience, which help me provide my clients with high-quality and detailed electrical and 
  electronics drawings, 2D layout and editing, and isometric drawings. With almost two years of experience as an electrical engineer 
  in a design firm, I was able to draft multiple plans for residential and commercial areas.

  Aside from these skills, I am also an expert in using Excel, Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, and other related applications.

  I am currently upskilling by taking Web Development Bootcamp in Udemy taught by Angela Yu. I wanted to learn how to code so that
  I will be able to live my life. By changing career path and having a career in tech, I can see myself happy, contented, and fulfilled
  not only in my chosen profession but also in my personal life. I want to live more, to experience more, and to travel more.
  And this is the start to my someday.
